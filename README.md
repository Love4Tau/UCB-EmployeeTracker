  ## Description
  In this project, I used technologies like inquirer and mysql2 to create a CLI app for tracking employees. I struggled with syntax errors which delayed my progress hugely - I was unable to source my sql files. I used the bootcamp AI xpert tool which helped me find what the error codes indicated - I finally got the app to start/prompt for user input. Getting all the data from my tables and sending that data to the user was pretty straightforward but I needed to google how to add to my tables (Will add documentation in credits field). Overall, I had fun creating another CLI app. I enjoy how easy it is to prompt for user input and use the user input using inquirer.

  ## Credits
  I re-watched our cloud recordings and looked through our class activities for assistance setting up the connection.js, schema.sql and seeds.sql! I had to use the xpert tool to refresh my memory on how to source the schema and seeds file. I also had to use the ai tool for assistance fixing mysql errors. 
  
  I used google to search for how to add values to tables:
